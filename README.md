# ChocobotRO Content

Assortment of content made by various scripters that have been modified and implemented into ChocobotRO.

## Installation

- 2018 kRO client
- rAthena server

## Usage

### `Client` folder
Content of files here should be appended or inserted into the most relevant place according to the filepath/name.
Most of the time the files should live in your `.grf` file rather than RO directory.

### `Server` folder
Similar to the `Client` folder, append or insert the content into the file if it exists otherwise create a new entry in the designated path.
